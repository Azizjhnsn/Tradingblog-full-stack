This is not actually something I learned but
 I understood that I have been working most about rendering for the past few mounths
  with express using express-ejs-layouts and with react js 
  now I'll segment them and only do anything relatted to rendering with react
   and use express only for backen so spend les time using coplicated ejs-layouts


Mongoose is nonrelational therefore can't link different tables together that iis why 
I used express session to store user name in order to know which user posted what

we always set express session parameter(or jwt ) in the app.js

mongoDB records Ids are a random st of characterfa-spin

we set timestamps to true whenever we want to keep track of when data has been added or updated in the database since mongoDB
does not have automating date & time recording like mysql
