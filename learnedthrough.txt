This is not actually something I learned but
 I understood that I have been working most about rendering for the past few mounths
  with express using express-ejs-layouts and with react js 
  now I'll segment them and only do anything relatted to rendering with react
   and use express only for backen so spend les time using coplicated ejs-layouts


Mongoose is nonrelational therefore can't link different tables together that iis why 
I used express session to store user name in order to know which user posted what

we always set express session parameter(or jwt ) in the app.js

mongoDB records Ids are a random st of characterfa-spin

we set timestamps to true whenever we want to keep track of when data has been added or updated in the database since mongoDB
does not have automating date & time recording like mysql

Todays task will be to change the ejs posts page in order to manually upload content and then connect the data updating function with our database

So to do that ill first use ejs to create a variable that will hold the text of our update 
Then clone the html element that holds the text content and all it s design
And then pass in the varible that holds our input via ejs

The middleware for data retrieval is storing the data in an array of object 

Able to access the post data from the db with the middleware

Updated the login system for case sensitiveness

Tryng to upate the ejs file
