This is not actually something I learned but
 I understood that I have been working most about rendering for the past few mounths
  with express using express-ejs-layouts and with react js 
  now I'll segment them and only do anything relatted to rendering with react
   and use express only for backen so spend les time using coplicated ejs-layouts
